System Requirements 
This system is tested compatible with IRIS Toolbox version
IRIS_Tbx_20130523, and MATLAB 2012a/b. 

The package contains several m files that are described below. The script Driver.m integrates all steps together. To make specifications for each step, specify the parameters as described below.

Step 0. Software initialization

Please copy the location of your IRIS Toolbox folder to the line in
file addMyPath.m and run the script. This script needs to be run only once per MATLAB session.

Step 1. readDefinitions.m

countrycode [string]: three-letter country code used to identify the country.

startyear [year format in IRIS]: the year to start the filter, eg. yy(year).

startest [year format in IRIS]: the year for the start of sample used for Bayesian estimation.

endyear [year format in IRIS]: the year for the end of the sample for both estimation and filtration.

endhist [year format in IRIS]: the year indicating the end of historical data.

modfile [string]: name of the model file.

P [struct]: Specify all the parameters in the model.
			If the parameters are included in the prior distributions section, the posteriors will overwrite the parameters specified here.
			The standard deviations of the consensus forecasts will be estimated as RMSEs once the readdata.m script is executed.
			For detailed choices on values / ratios for the parameters, please refer to the working paper.

E [struct]: Specify prior distributions for parameters. These priors will be used by the file estimateModel.m, described in step 4, below.
			The structure of the prior specification is:
			E.param={initial value (usually same as prior mean),lower bound,upper bound,logdist.normal(prior mean,prior standard deviation)}
			
datafile [string]: the name of database in csv format.
			The database should include: historical and expert forcasts, and judgment variables if applicable. The historical and forecast data is be identified using the 'endhist' date provided above.

judgment [0 or 1]: 0 ~ no judgment; 1 ~ judgment on unobservables to be applied (potential growth,output gap or NAIRU) and be provided in the *.csv database.

Caveat: To avoid overdetermination, when entering potential growth and output gap for more than one year, AVOID entering both potential growth and output gap for any 2 consecutive years.
For example, if tuning potential growth and output gap for 2014 and 2015, it is OK to specify:

* potential growth for 2014 and 2015, and output gap for 2014;

* potential growth for 2014 and 2014, and output gap for 2015;

* potential growth for 2014, and output gap for 2014 and 2015;

* potential growth for 2015, and output gap for 2014 and 2015;

BUT NOT: 

* potential growth for 2014 and 2015, and output gap for 2014 and 2015.

Step 2. readModel
The model file is called MVF_wp1579.model. Please see IRIS manual and tutorials for an explanation of the *.model file.

Step 3. readdata.m
Script will load the data described below.
Note:
1) Definitions are already included in the comment line in the *.csv database file. All units are in percentage points except LGDP.
2) In case a particular variable is not available or of poor quality, please keep it, but fill the values with NaN.
3) In case a some particular forecasts are not not available, or can only be provided intermittently, just fill the missing values with NaN.

PIE_			CPI inflation
PIE_CONS1_		1 yr ahead consensus inflation
LGDP_			100 * ln of real GDP
GROWTH_			real GDP growth
GROWTH_CONS1_	1 yr ahead consensus GDP growth
GROWTH_CONS2_	2 yr ahead consensus GDP growth
GROWTH_CONS3_	3 yr ahead consensus GDP growth
GROWTH_CONS4_	4 yr ahead consensus GDP growth
GROWTH_CONS5_	5 yr ahead consensus GDP growth
UNR_			unemployment rate
GROWTH_BAR_		judgment on potential growth
UNR_BAR_		judgment on NAIRU
Y_				judgment on output gap



Step 4. estimateModel.m
The script read priors from step 1, and estimate parameters using bayesian methods as described in IRIS manual. The estimated parameters are saved as model object "mest". 

Step 5. filterModel.m
Using etimated parameters, this script applies Kalman smoother to obtain estimates for the unobservable variables.
Note that Step 4 is not required when the filtration uses the parameters defined in the structure P in step 1. In this case, the model object to use is "m" instead of "mest".																																													  

Step 6. saveResult.m
Output for all variables of the model are saved in the filtModel_date.csv file, under the country folder.
