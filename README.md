# Oxford-Writing-Sample
This repository holds the replication code of my writing sample for the MPhil + DPhil program at University of Oxford.

To run the code run the master do file for STATA regressions and the F_LP_IRF.R code for the non-linear local projections. The intermediate dataset is the Panel.dta file.
